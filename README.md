# Shopping Cart Kata

## The Challenge

To create a simple checkout system that consumes data representing a current basket, and when queried responds with the subtotal of the items accounting for special prices.

## The Data

### Pricing structure

| Item Code | Unit Price | Special Price |
| :-------- | :--------- | :------------ |
| A         | 50         | 3 for 140     |
| B         | 35         | 2 for 60      |
| C         | 25         |               |
| D         | 12         |               |

### Example Basket Data

```
[
    {
        "code": "A",
        "quantity": 3
    },
    {
        "code": "B",
        "quantity": 3
    },
    {
        "code": "C",
        "quantity": 1
    },
    {
        "code": "D",
        "quantity": 2
    }
]
```
